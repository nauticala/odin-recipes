# odin-recipes
I am setting up a small recipe webpage showcasing how very little I know about cooking, as well as my extremely bland pallet! I will use my basic HTML knowledge to create a very brutalist style page, with the hopes of soon coming back to dress it up with much more spice than I will be using in these recipes.

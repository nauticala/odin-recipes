<h1>Black Coffee</h1>
<img src="../images/black-coffee.jpg">
<p>The popular thing it seems now is to dress coffee up as
    much as possible. I still drink my coffee black, I start with it
    whole bean, and I do not use an electric coffee maker. I drink
    a lot of coffee, so you would think I would dress it up sometime,
    but here I am, enjoying my boring and flavorless cup of mud.</p>
<p>Now you'll need a coffee grinder, and a french press. I use an 
    electric kettle to warm my water, but you can always do it on 
    a stove. I also only ever make one cup at a time. When purchasing
    a french press, it normally includes a scoop and estimates how
    much coffee you will need. I typically use a bit more than the 
    recommended dose. It's just trial and error - do what tastes best
    for you!</p>
<p>Here are the steps I take:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Grind the beans with a grinder</li>
    <li>Get your water warming up, either in a kettle or on the stove</li>
    <li>Put your scoop(s) of coffee grounds in the bottom of the french press</li>
    <li>Give the water a second to cool once it is brought to boil</li>
    <li>Most french presses recommend letting it brew in the french press for about
        four minutes, but you can leave it longer if you want it stronger</li>
    <li>Enjoy your coffee! Cream and suger are added calories, so I avoid all of that</li>
</ol>

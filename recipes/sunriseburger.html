<h1>Sunrise Burger</h1>

<p><strong>Finally!</strong> Some food with some flavor!</p>
<p>Now obviously, a burger can include any toppings you so desire, but I
    am <em>boring</em> and I don't have much fun when I cook. I will
    go over the backbone of what I do, please dress it up as you see fit!</p>
<p>Burgers for me are perfect after a long day of rock climbing, or paddle boarding.
    For a sunrise burger, the main ingredients are your hamburger patty and an egg.
    Many people add bacon and hashbrowns!</p>
<ol>
    <li>First, start with the hamburger meat. If needed, form it into patties</li>
    <li>Clean and preheat the grill</li>
    <li>Throw the patties on there and let them cook until they are done</li>
    <li>Fry up an egg, I like mine medium since it is less messy. Most people
        do them over easy, nice and runny</li>
    <li>Put it all together on a bun!</li>
    <li>Add any topping you like in the step. I always add hot sauce!</li>

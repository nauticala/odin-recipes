<h1>Meal Replacement Smoothie</h1>
<img src="../images/meal-replacement-scoop.jpg">
<p class="body-para">Again, I am boring when it comes to my eating habits. Most days
    for my lunch, I make a boring smoothie with a meal replacement powder.
    I get all of the nutrients I need in what I consider an efficient and
    inexpensive manner. I also do not have the burden of trying to come up
    with something enjoyable and flavorful each day, which I consider <em>exhausting</em>.</p>
<p class="body-para">I personally use Huel black edition vanilla as my meal replacement.
    I work out a lot and frequently rock climb, so I like the extra protein
    to help fuel my muscles. Vanilla is also the most flavorless for my
    deprived taste buds, but you can get as adventuress as you would like!</p>
<ol>
    <li>Grab the blender</li>
    <li>Start by adding the meal replacement powder</li>
    <li>At this point, use whatever berries you would like! I opt for a 
        small portion of blueberries most days</li>
    <li>Next, we add the liquids! I like to include a splash of cold brew, but 
        the main ingredient here is (for me) a plant-based milk with added protein</li>
    <li>Blend it up and enjoy! Or don't, I just try to chug it down and get on with my day</li>
</ol>
